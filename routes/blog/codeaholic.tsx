      ### My name is Bjørn and I'm a codeaholic!

      <br />

      <p>
        People call me a founder and an entrepreneur. I am not. I am just a guy
        who likes to code and make stuff. I am a true codeaholic.
      </p>

      <br />

      - I code because it makes me feel happy. - I code to experience pleasure
      and satisfaction. - I code because it makes me relax. - I code to enjoy
      myself. - I code to reward myself. - I code to escape from reality. - I
      code to cope with stress or problems. - I code to alleviate anxiety.

      <br />

      All this coding sometimes results in useful and often good products.

      <br />

      But....

      <br />

      - I choose to code instead of trying to sell my stuff. - I choose to code
      instead of meeting potential customers. - I choose to code instead of
      trying to find potential investors. - I choose to code instead of doing
      marketing. - I choose to code instead of sending out invoices. - I choose
      to code long into the night even though I know it hurts my sleep. - I
      choose to code instead of hanging with friends.

      <br />

      And...

      <br />

      - I lie about how much I code. - I lie about how often I code. - I mostly
      code alone. - I code a lot in the morning before breakfast. - I neglect my
      responsibilities and keep on coding. - I have blackouts and forget the
      world around me while coding. - I become irritable if I am not able to
      code for a while. - I think about coding all day, every day. - I ignore my
      health and prioritise coding. - I have coding benders that lasts for days.

      <br />

      Can anyone help me? Seriously.
